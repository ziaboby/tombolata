# Tombola

Small app to play _Tombola_ with family and friends during COVID.

This code was written at Christmas day more like a stream of consciousness. It will probably contains some bugs and a bad UX.

Features:

- cards mode: generate six cards, each with random 15 numbers
- _tombolone_ mode: extract a random number between 1 and 90

## CLI Commands

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
preact build --no-prerender
```
